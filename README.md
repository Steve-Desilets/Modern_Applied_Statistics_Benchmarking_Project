# Modern Applied Statistics Benchmarking Project

For the project contained within this repository, we put ourselves in the position of a data scientist working for a company whose leadership team is interested in evaluating the financial and operational benefits of switching from R to Golang for data science programs that will be run by cloud providers. For this study, the company's leadership team requests that the data scientist use Golang and R to implement one of the eight most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years (as identified by Dr. Andrew Gelman and Dr. Aki Vehtari), which are listed below (Gellman and Vehtari 2022).

1) Counterfactual causal inference
2)  Bootstrapping and simulation-based inference
3)  Overparameterized models and regularization
4)  Bayesian multilevel models
5)  Generic computation algorithms
6)  Adaptive decision analysis
7)  Robust inference
8)  Exploratory data analysis

The company's leadership team requests that the data scientist conduct benchmarking experiments to understand the memory usage and computational speed with which Golang and R can complete identical data science tasks. Based on these measurements, leadership requests that the data scientist estimate the financial implications of selecting Golang or R for such data science computing operations. In addition, the company's leadership team also wants to understand whether both languages can be leveraged for logging, testing, and profiling for these types of experiments. The company's leadership team requests that the data scientist deliver a report outlining findings and recommendations related to all of these subjects.
   
To achieve the study's objectives, the data scientist creates two programs that conduct bootstrapping to calculate standard errors, which are then leveraged to calculate 95% confidence intervals.  One of these programs - "Modern_Applied_Statistics_In_Go.go" - is written in Golang, and the other program - "Modern_Applied_Statistics_In_R.R" - is written in R. For these confidence intervals calculated via bootstrapping, both programs leverage the charges column of the "Medical Costs Personal Dataset" available on Kaggle (Choi 2018).  Each program implements 100 iterations of experimental trials.  For each of the 100 trials, the program draws 1,000 bootstrap samples to calculate a 95% confidence interval. The R program results in the "modernAppliedStatisticsOutputLogR.txt" file, which contains the outputs of the program logging, the results of the confidence interval calculation unit test, the post-bootstrapping confidence interval estimates, the total memory used by the program, and summary statistics about the distribution of runtimes per experimental trial.  The Golang program produces the same outputs across three different files in this repository: "logGolang.txt", "profileGolang.txt", and "bootstrappingGolangOutput.txt."

To summarize the results of the study, the data scientist was able to successfully implement the bootstrapping and confidence interval calculation experiments in both R and Golang.  Furthermore, the data scientist was able to successfully implement profiling, logging, unit testing, and benchmarking in both programs as well.  Logging conveyed that both programs ran fully without encountering errros. Both programs also passed their respective confidence interval calculation unit tests. Profiling revealed that Golang and R each leveraged a total of 1,089,291,280 and 386,512 bytes of memory for the identical experiments, respectively.  Meanwhile, benchmarking revealed that average experimental runtime for each of the experimental trials in Golang and R were 31,175 microseconds and 284,458 microseconds, respectively. The data scientist also projected how much it would cost the company to run each of these programs using computing services provided by OVHcloud.  According to OVHcloud's website, since these programs leverage less than 7 gigabytes of memory, the company could sign up for the corresponding General Purpose computing plan, which charges $0.0813 per hour (OVHcloud 2024). Combining this information with the benchmarking results from this study, we find that the the projected costs for running these Golang and R programs using OVHcloud would be $0.0000007  and  $0.0000064, respectively.

If I were to make a recommendation to management based on the findings of this study, I would encourage leadership to consider its primary goals regarding modern applied statistics computations when making their decision about whether to proceed with R or Golang. If leadership's primary goal is computational speed, then the company should begin leveraging Golang for modern applied statistics, since Golang performed much more quickly in the benchmarking portion of this study. If leadership's primary goal is memory usage minimization, then the company should leverage R, since R utilized less memory in the profiling portion of this study. If leadership's goal is cost minimization, then the company should leverage Golang, since Golang resulted in lowered projected costs in that portion of this study.  With the results of this study in hand, the leadership team at this company should be well-positioned to make an informed decision about which programming language is best suited to meet its primary organizational goals regarding modern applied statistics.
